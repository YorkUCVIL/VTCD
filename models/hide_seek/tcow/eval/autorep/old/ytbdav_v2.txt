# (5) Davis (_y).

# NOTE: Constructed looking at v111_y8 results (nf=30, qt=0).
# NOTE: May contain duplicates because markers are considered independently.
# NOTE: There is no containment in DAVIS or YTVOS.
# NOTE: IOT marker is a special case here in the wild!
# Workflow: always keep this file updated, then copy to categorizations downstream.

# NO: No (or only partial) occlusion.
