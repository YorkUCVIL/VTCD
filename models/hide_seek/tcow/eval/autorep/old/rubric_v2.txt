# BVH, Nov 2022.
# See pick_represent.py for how this is processed.

# TODO for v3:
# - I recorded more videos, especially RT / HD.

# (3) Real benchmark (_r).

# NOTE: Constructed looking at v111_r8 results (nf=30, qt=0).
# NOTE: May contain duplicates because markers are considered independently.
# NOTE: Some markers (HD, RT, SA) only exists here!
# NOTE: NA = not anonymous (has faces): everything in 1_boxcare (which corresponds to batch1, batch2, batch3 in Phone Raw):
# behind*, box*, boxfail*, boxpush*, fall*, recurse*; all ignored for now due to no annotations.
# Workflow: always keep this file updated, then copy to categorizations downstream.


# NO: No (or only partial) occlusion or containment.
