# BVH, Oct 2022.
# See pick_represent.py for how this is processed.

# (3) Real benchmark (_r).
# NOTE: this list was constructed looking at v104 results, so nf=30, qt=0.

# NOTE: NA = not anonymous (has faces): everything in 1_boxcare:
# - behind*, box*, boxfail*, boxpush*, fall*, recurse*
# - ^ all ignored for now due to no annotations (yet)

# Workflow: always keep this _all file updated, then copy to categorizations _x downstream.


# Level 0: No object permanence required (apart from re-identification after potential out-of-frame):

pump1_scan_i9_f30           # 4_home


# Level 1: Simple active or passive occlusion or containment:

teaduck4_reveal_i5_f15      # 2_teaduck
teaduck5_cammove_i5_f15     # 2_teaduck (OOD: camera)
teaduck6_teamove_i5_f15     # 2_teaduck
mugduck1_mugmove_i4_f10     # 3_mugduck (not L2: cutoff!)
mugduck2_reveal_i5_f20      # 3_mugduck

lightball6_occl4x_i10_f15   # 7_ballbounce (OOD: bounce)


# Level 3: Double and/or transferring containment or occlusion:

bagduck4_transfer_i5_f22    # 5_bagmugduck (OOD: paper bags)


# Level 4: Container gets occluded and/or occluder gets contained and/or significant irreducible ambiguity:
