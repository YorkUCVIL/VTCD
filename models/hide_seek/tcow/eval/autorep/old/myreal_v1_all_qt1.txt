# See pick_represent.py for how this is processed.

# (3) Real benchmark (_r).
# NOTE: this list was copied from myreal_v1_all_qt0, and then adjusted _f value to work for qt=0.05! so this is probably not optimal, but tentatively used for older models that have qt>0.


# Level 0: No object permanence required (apart from re-identification after potential out-of-frame):
chips1_oof_i5_f35           # 4_home (OOD: deformable)
pump1_scan_i9_f21           # 4_home


# Level 1: Simple active or passive occlusion or containment:
teaduck1_i5_f45             # 2_teaduck
teaduck2_i5_f10             # 2_teaduck
teaduck3_reveal_i5_f10      # 2_teaduck
teaduck4_reveal_i5_f10      # 2_teaduck
teaduck5_cammove_i5_f10     # 2_teaduck (OOD: camera)
teaduck6_teamove_i5_f10     # 2_teaduck
mugduck1_mugmove_i4_f6     # 3_mugduck (not L2: cutoff!)
mugduck2_reveal_i5_f15      # 3_mugduck
mugduck3_reveal_i3_f12      # 3_mugduck
pumpcookie1_reveal_i6_f14   # 4_home
mugduck5_stay_i5_f15        # 5_bagmugduck 


# Level 2: Moving container and/or snitch during occlusion:
mugduck4_mugmove_i5_f35     # 3_mugduck
multicupduck1_game_i5_f25   # 3_mugduck; undecided
multicupduck1_game_i7_f23   # 3_mugduck; undecided
multicupduck1_game_i9_f21   # 3_mugduck; undecided
mugduck7_shuffle_i6_f24     # 5_bagmugduck
handball1_wave_i3_f2        # 6_handball (OOD: hands)
lightball4_occl1x_i9_f31    # 7_ballbounce (OOD: bounce)
lightball5_occl2x_i7_f23    # 7_ballbounce (OOD: bounce)
lightball6_occl4x_i10_f5   # 7_ballbounce (OOD: bounce)


# Level 3: Double and/or transferring containment or occlusion:
bagduck1_move_i5_f45        # 5_bagmugduck (OOD: paper bags)
bagduck3_recurse_i5_f10     # 5_bagmugduck (OOD: paper bags)
bagduck4_transfer_i5_f17    # 5_bagmugduck (OOD: paper bags)


# Level 4: Container gets occluded and/or occluder gets contained and/or significant irreducible ambiguity:
mugduck6_shuffle_i6_f24     # 5_bagmugduck
handball2_boxoccl_i5_f25    # 6_handball; undecided (OOD: hands)
